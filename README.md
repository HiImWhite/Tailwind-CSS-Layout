# Tailwind-CSS-Layout

Responsive layout made using Tailwind CSS for academic classes.

- Documentation and installation for Tailwind CSS - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

- To run this layout open the Tailwind-CSS-Layout folder, run IDE, go into src folder and run index.html.

This project was made to learn about pixel-perfect and responsive creation of layouts. Tailwind is used to ease some work.
Project needs some fixes, which will be done possibly in the future to solidify knowledge of CSS and Tailwind.
